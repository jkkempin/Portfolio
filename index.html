        <p>Hi, my name is Jennifer and I am a web developer.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class= 'two'>
        <p>I recently completed the Front End Web Development bootcamp program through Thinkful.
            Coding has been an exciting career change for me after 8 years as a middle-school teacher in
            inner-city schools.  I love to learn new things, and am a great problem solver.  I get to do both 
            of these things as a front end developer.  It is very exciting to figure out how to take an idea 
            and turn it into a functioning page.  I enjoy and work best when working with a great team.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of coding you can find me traveling to new cities and taking my son on adventures to 
            see new places.  I also love to read a great book, and am currently taking horseback rinding 
            lessons.</p>

            <h3>Fossil Quiz App</h3>
            <p>Test your knowledge of dinosaur fossils.  This app was inspired by my 4 year old son who is on a 
                big dinosaur kick and is a great app for anyone looking to learn something new about dinosaur fossils.
                 This 5 question quiz does not allow the user to move on until they chose an answer
                for each question, gives them feedback when they chose the wrong answer, and resets the quiz if they 
                would like to try again.  The app tracks and displays the user's score on each question.</p>
            <p>Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery</p>
