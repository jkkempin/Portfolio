        <p>Hi, my name is Jennifer and I am a web developer.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <p>I recently completed the Front End Web Development bootcamp program 
        through Thinkful.  Coding has been an exciting career change for me 
        after 8 years as a middle-school teacher in inner-city schools.  I 
        love to learn new things, and am a great problem solver.  I get to do 
        both of these things as a front end developer.  It is very exciting 
        to figure out how to take an idea and turn it into a functioning page.</p>

        <p>Outside of coding you can find me traveling to new cities and taking 
        my son on adventures to see new places.  I also love to read a great 
        book, and am currently taking horseback rinding lessons.  </p>
